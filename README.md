### Answer Tracker:
The Answer tracking section of the main game screen will display a placeholder area on which the player's guesses will be compared to the answer - each time the player guesses a letter correctly, one of the blank slots will be displaced by the correct letter, continuing until either the player has ran out of guesses, or until the player has correctly guessed all the letters in the word:

### Guess Counters:
There are two counting sections under the answer tracker, which will display to the user their progress in terms of how many guesses they have remaining, and how many guesses they have used in the game so far:

### Previous Guesses Recording:
This feature will record each previous guess a player has entered, and display the previous guesses as a list of comma separated letters below the guess-counter section. This will aid the user in terms of avoiding double-guessing a letter, and not having to try remember a long list of previous guesses:
