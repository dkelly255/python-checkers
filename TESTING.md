# Testing

## Generic Testing - PEP8 Validation
I have used the PEP8 Python code validation service to test the entire program code and resolved all errors & addressed all recommendations. The confirmation output has passed without any errors, notifications or warnings as shown in screenshot below:

## User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
In order to thoroughly test the functionality of my application, I sought out resources online in terms of approaches & techniques for effective User Acceptance Testing.

I found the below article from [Guru99](https://www.guru99.com/download-sample-test-case-template-with-explanation-of-important-fields.html) to be particularly applicable to my use-case scenario, and have modified their approach & template to better fit my specific application scenarios - with each test case detailed below
